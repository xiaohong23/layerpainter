On another note, please don't treat this addon as an replacement for Substance Painter or a comparable software. It might be able to do the basic things that those can do but they are specialized programs. The main limit for LayerPainter is the viewport which, with Eevee, can get quite slow, especially if you use a lot of procedural textures. The advantage of this addon is that you can do everything right in blender and don't need to switch between multiple packages.

The last option deletes the layer. The final icon is the indicator for the Atomic Datamanager Addon . Layer Stack The options shown in a layer depend on the selected channel. The blending mode only exists for channels apart from the Layer channel. You can change the visibility, name, blending mode, opacity and the tag color of the layer and its channels. Layer Settings Here you have the settings for the currently selected layer. On the top of this panel you can switch between the different settings. The next option is a list of the channels that are active for this layer. You can expand the dropdown to enable or disable channels. Below you have a button 'Open' which opens a file browser. Here you can select textures which will get added to their corresponding channels. The LSS Button can be used to import textures from an URL. The 'Textures' Button opens a thumbnail preview which shows the textures from the paths you can specify in the addon preferences . Underneath the texture buttons you have a panel to select a layer material. You can add custom layer materials in the preferences . Once you've selected a layer material, you can expand the box to change its settings. The button on the right of the node material enables all channels that can make use of the selected material. Each channel has buttons to switch between the channels modes. The first option is a simple value. The second option allows you to select a texture for that channel.
