Move Over Closed Group When you move a layer towards a closed group and this option is enabled, instead of moving in the group, it will treat the whole group as a single layer and move past it.

Custom Groups The folder path you specify here should lead to a folder, which has your custom assets. These will get imported when you activate the addon in a file.

These shortcuts are: Layer Stack: CTRL + RIGHTMOUSE Layer Settings: RIGHTMOUSE Toggle painting This button is only a temporary solution. It can be used to exit out of texture painting mode when Layer Painter automatically switches to it. It also prevents the automatic toggling of texture painting mode. Once this bug is resolved, this will be removed. A Layer Painter active tool will be added to texture painting mode, which can then show the Layer Painter settings. Layer Stack The layer stack has the dropdowns for material and channel selection as well as the layer operators. It also has all the layers of your materials. Material Dropdown This dropdown allows you to select the material you're currently editing. Tip If there are any issues with your layer stack, try reselecting the active material. This will reload the layers and might fix issues. Reset Material This button will show up if the addon wasn't able to recognize the node layout of your material. This shouldn't appear when you don't edit the material by hand, except for once when you haven't done anything with the material. The button will remove all nodes in the selected material and set up the nodes required for the addon. Channel Dropdown This is the channel you are currently editing. \"Layer\" will affect the entire layer, while the other channels will just change the current channel. This dropdown will have an affect on the following things: Layer Stack: All channels can have different opacities and channels can be hidden invdividually. The individual channels also have a blending mode, \"Layer\" doesn't have that. Masks: If you add a mask, it will be added for the selected channel. This means that you can have different masks for different channels. Channel Preview This adds an emmission node inbetween the active channel and the output node.

At the moment there are two addons that are \"supported\" by Layer Painter. This means that if you have them installed, some of their features are integrated into the Layer Painter workflow in some form. This does not mean that the code of these addons is in Layer Painter. If you don't have them installed and don't want to, you can disable their information buttons in the settings . Lily Surface Scrapper This addon by \u00c9lie Michel allows you to import textures from a URL . This means you can for example go to texturehaven.com and select a textureset. Then copy the URL and enter it in the addons popup. The addon is supported like this: When you're editing a Fill Layer , you can press the URL button and enter the URL. Layer Painter will then import the downloaded textures and try to apply them to the correct channel . This will speed up your workflow a lot, because you don't have to download and select your textures manually, but can just enter the URL and the rest will happen for you. You can get the addon here . Data Manager Disclaimer This addon is not yet released. As soon as it is, these features will be available. This addon by Grant Wilk allows you to clean and organize your blend files. You can get statistics about the objects, images, materials and much more in your file. The addon is supported like this: There is a small white indicator in the Layer settings panel , which will show you if there are any unused images in your file.
